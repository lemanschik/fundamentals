## Content Versioning
Is based via a Hash Algorythm at present sha256 is the smallest good denominator while incremental gets raised if
The Amount of Shards would require that eg: Multi Yottabyte (YB) Scale takes 2048 so it is mostly the best to chunk that. Until Exabyte Scale your fine with 512. 256 fits well till Petrabyte PB

## Object Creation via a Compiler
When we generate a .so or o or .a we create a corrosponding .d.ts .js or js including type annotations as jsdoc
the feature type annotations is not implemented at present but has high priority it will replace the need for Typescripts Compiler Step.

## CPP Objects
see: Object Creation via a Compiler

## Working with Objects in general eg:
Everything in ECMAScript is a Object so a AST Node we directly execute that AST this is the concept of a VM in general Software gets Compiled
in general into something that is called a Stack Based Machine so every Binary is a Virtual Machine a Stack Machine it contains boot instructions
the Binary Header like your Operating System but in small.

ECMAScript adds a Nice readable Linking Concept on top of that called Module System. It has a Nice Static Analyzeable Syntax ideal to build Software.
It is Also Highly Extend able via the Fact that everything is a Object that is also Modify able. You should not fall into the trap that you
should use this features abusiv less code is better code as always!

## Good Code Messurement Factors are:
- Size
- Benchmark
 - Execution on a Fixed Physical Hardware Machine Most best smallest denominator that you target to work on.
 - Installation time
 - Update time and size
 - ~ram usage ~hdd meta usage
 - cpu ram hdd meta relational throughput (Vertical Scaleablity)
 - benchmark overall throughput for a fixed workload that does not change.
